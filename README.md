Homework one was very interesting. Since I have not coding in a year or so I really started out struggling. I had forgotten a lot about coding. 
Once I got back into the swing of things and finally started understanding the code that I was typing out it became quite fun. I enjoyed relearning about Divs and how 
to make my website responsive. I chose a space theme. I really think that making a website is calming. 
In the beginning I did have troubles. I originally thought that this project was going to be a breeze but after a year and a half without coding websites I had realized
that I had forgotten almost everything. I had to go and look through my notes to figure out what exactly I could do. I even watched some youtube videos. 
once I figured out the boiler plate of the website I honestly took off from there. I started remembering the codes and exactly what did what. I did have to search up a few
things on W3schools but I was very proud to have made this mostly without help.
